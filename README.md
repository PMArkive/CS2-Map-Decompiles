# CS2 Decompiled Maps

Collection of decompiled CS2 maps in json format that allows people to easily create configs for the Zombie Escape gamemode.

> [!NOTE]
> All map decompiles are based off of [GFL's Zombie Escape Maps Collection](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3070555563), and may differ from other servers running their own reuploads.
